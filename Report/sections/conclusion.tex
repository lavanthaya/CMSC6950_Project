\section{Conclusion}

Computation tools help in many ways as a part of the computing process. Compared to other programming languages, python is becoming more trendy and easy to use. As it already penetrated almost every technology field like web technology, data science, artificial intelligence etc., it is worth learning. Python is open-source and well maintained until up to date, so it’s more reliable and can always seek community support. Bash scripts and git tools are the most valuable components in development. With bash script, we can automate any tasks in Linux and also can use it for computation. Git is an excellent tool for source code version control and GitHub globally acts as a central portal for shared works. Can easily interact and contribute to group projects by using git. \newline

\noindent The major part of this project involves using the argopy python library. Undoubtedly, argopy fills the gap in the ocean science community by providing the most convenient approach to access a large and complex dataset which is very important in ocean science. It’s well documented and maintained by a group of developers, so anyone can easily use it for their research by simply going through the argopy documentation or user manual. The argopy developers in GitHub are so responsive and can always get support in a short period. One of the major issues faced using argopy is loading data from “Argovis” or “Errdap”, and anytime those servers can go down.
