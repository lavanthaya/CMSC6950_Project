\textbf{Abstract} \newline

The scope of this project is to demonstrate the skills learned in computation tools, such as Linux operation system administration, bash scripting, git, data models and python programming with different libraries. In order to explore and apply the skill sets, a domain-specific title was chosen, and its software library packages were used to solve two different tasks. The tasks includes one computation and visualization of the computation results. \newline

\noindent Throughout these activities, it was expected to present the idea of a chosen project software library and how it can be used to solve that domain-related task. In this project, it was discussed about an open-source library package called ArgoPy, which is an ocean data repository. It can be used to call ocean data set through simple API call by using the ArgoPy python library. A python scripts were written to solve those two computation tasks and to plot the computation results as a project outcome.
